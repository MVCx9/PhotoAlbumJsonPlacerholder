# Photo Albums Application

This project is a sample application developed with Spring Boot and Kotlin. It provides an API to obtain a list of albums and the details of photos in each album using data from [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com).

It will help you to enhance your skills in Kotlin and Spring Boot by providing a practical example of how to build a RESTful API with these technologies.

## Technologies Used

- **Kotlin:** A modern and safe programming language for application development.
- **Spring Boot:** A framework that simplifies enterprise application development.
- **Maven:** A project management and build tool.

## Project Architecture
The application follows the hexagonal architecture pattern (ports and adapters) to ensure a modular and maintainable structure. The main components are:

- Controllers: Handle HTTP requests and delegate business logic to the service.
- Services: Contain the application's business logic.
- Clients: Make calls to external services such as JSONPlaceholder.
- Configuration: Manages the configuration of application components like RestTemplate and ObjectMapper.
- Entity: Define the data models used in the application.
